\section{Experiment}

Total scattering measurements~\cite{terba;cr21,egami;b;utbp03} were performed at beamline ID31 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The sample powders were loaded into cylindrical slots (approx. 1~mm thickness) held between Kapton windows in a high-throughput sample holder. Each sample was measured in a transmission with an incident X-ray energy of 75.00 keV ($\lambda = 0.1653$ \AA). Measured intensities were collected using a Pilatus CdTe 2M detector ($1679 \times 1475$ pixels, $172 \times 172$ $\mu$m$^2$ each) positioned with the incident beam in the corner of the detector. The sample-to-detector distance was approximately 0.3~m for the total scattering measurement. Background measurements for the empty windows were measured and subtracted. NIST SRM 660b (LaB$_6$) was used for geometry calibration performed with the software pyFAI followed by image integration including a flat-field, geometry, solid-angle, and polarization corrections.\\

\section{Overview of the measurements}


Preliminary PDF data were processed in an automated way using PDFgetX3~\cite{peter;jac03,billi;jpcm13,juhas;jac13} with $Q_{max}=$30, 25, 20, and 15~\AA$^{-1}$. Then the data were reprocessed using a Lorch modification function~\cite{lorch;jppcs69} to suppress termination effects and contributions from high frequency noise. The small-angle scattering intensities were extrapolated from $Q_{min}=0.326$~\AA$^{-1}$ to 0. Compositions used for the samples were used from the compounds given in the sample spreadsheet. The data can be rapidly reprocessed given new composition details or other desired modifications to the processing parameters. In the following plots, the dotted line in the plots of $F(Q)$ represent the $Q_{min}$ value and the grey highlighted region in the plots of $G(r)$ represent the unreliable part of the low-$r$ range due to the rpoly value used in PDFgetX3.\\
