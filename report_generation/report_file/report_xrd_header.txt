\section{Experiment}
High-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction were performed at beamline ID31 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The sample powders were loaded into cylindrical slots (approx. 1~mm thickness) held between Kapton windows in a high-throughput sample holder. Each sample was measured in a transmission with an incident X-ray energy of 75.00 keV ($\lambda = 0.1653$ \AA). Measured intensities were collected using a Pilatus CdTe 2M detector ($1679 \times 1475$ pixels, $172 \times 172$ $\mu$m$^2$ each) positioned with the incident beam in the corner of the detector. The sample-to-detector distance was approximately 1.5~m for the high-resolution measurements
Background measurements for the empty windows were measured and subtracted. NIST SRM 660b (LaB$_6$) was used for geometry calibration performed with the software pyFAI followed by image integration including a flat-field, geometry, solid-angle, and polarization corrections.


\section{Acknowledgement}
If measured data are used in a publication, please include the following acknowledgement:
\begin{quote}
We acknowledge the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) for provision of synchrotron radiation facilities and Momentum Transfer for facilitating the measurements. Jakub Drnec is thanked for assistance and support in using beamline ID31. The measurement setup was developed with funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the STREAMLINE project (grant agreement ID 870313).

LaB$_6$ NIST SRM 660b (high $Q_{res}$): $R_w=4.21$\%\ (NIST certificate 4.15689~\AA) }

The instrumental profile is defined in the standard .inp file without offset correction, as below:
